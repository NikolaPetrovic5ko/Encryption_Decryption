\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em $\ast$message} & We are getting the message added by user from this parameter \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
This represent an empty string where we are going to put our encrypted message.

Number of characters in a row. Row is given by number next to \textquotesingle{}n\textquotesingle{}.

Arrays of characters which are located in a given row.

Getting a length of message.

Shows the position of letter \textquotesingle{}a\textquotesingle{} in encrypted message.

Pointers to given arrays and strings.

Calculate the distance between \textquotesingle{}a\textquotesingle{} and letter for encryption that is introduced by user.

Starting from the first character of message.

Encryption with first row

Starting from the first character of the first row.

{\bfseries Creating a circular moving for first row}

If position of a character is greater than the number of characters in a row, position of a that character is calculated with this formula.

In position of character of a given message insert encrypted character.

If position of a character is not greater than the number of characters in a row, inserting of encrypted character is proceed like this.

Encryption with second row

Starting from the first character of the second row.

{\bfseries Creating a circular moving for second row}

If position of a character is greater than the number of characters in a row, position of a that character is calculated with this formula.

In position of character of a given message insert encrypted character.

If position of a character is not greater than the number of characters in a row, inserting of encrypted character is proceed like this.

Encryption with third row

Starting from the first character of the third row.

{\bfseries Creating a circular moving for third row}

If position of a character is greater than the number of characters in a row, position of a that character is calculated with this formula.

In position of character of a given message insert encrypted character.

If position of a character is not greater than the number of characters in a row, inserting of encrypted character is proceed like this.

If character is not found in any of given rows, just insert a character from a given message.
